# Water Quality Index (WQI) and Water Quality Trend Analyses at Selected Ambient Monitoring Stations in B.C. 

### Usage

#### Data

#### Code
There are four core scripts that are required for the analysis, they need to be run in order:

- 00_install_packages.R
- 01_standardize_data.R
- 02_clean_data.R
- 03_test_trends.R
- 04_calc_limits.R
- 05_calc_wqi.R

The `run_all.R` script can be `source`ed to run it all at once.
